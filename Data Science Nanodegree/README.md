<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What I Did in This Course
Worked on numerous projects using Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Learn, and SQL, and learnt how to run data pipelines, design experiments, build recommendation systems, and deploy solutions to the cloud. The course can be found here: https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025

## Files
  Airbnb-Predictor: As a part of my data science journey, I decided it would be fun to take the AirBNB dataset and answer some questions I had about house prices.
  
  IBM_Recommender: Recommendation engine built with IBM, part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree
  
  Stroke-Prediction-App:  I trained and deployed an XGBoost Classifier to predict whether or not a user is likely to suffer from a stroke.
  
  disaster-pipeline: This is a website that displays statistics about tweets during a disaster, and predicts what type of disaster tweet a user inputted message is.
  
  Data Scientist Nanodegree Certificate.pdf: My certificate certifying I passed every assignment and completed the course.
