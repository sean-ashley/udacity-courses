<!-- PROJECT LOGO -->
<br />
  <h3 align="center">Deep Learning Nanodegree</h3>
  
  <p align="center">
    Here are all of the projects I worked on in this course. They include numerous different deep learning related concepts, such convolutional networks , recurrent networks, and generative adversarial networks. The course can be found here: https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What I Did in This Course
I Used PyTorch to build CNNs for image recognition, RNNs for sequence generation, GANs for image generation, and learnt how to deploy models accessible from a website using AWS SageMaker and Lambda.
 
## Files
  Style-Transfer: My rendition of the Style-Transfer from the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program.
  
  cancer-detection: A convolutional neural network model generated by PyTorch that classifies with a 76% accuracy 3 different skin lesions ; melanoma (malignant), seborrheic keratosis(benign), and nevus(benign).
  
  deployed-sentiment-analysis: RNN used to assess whether or not a review is positive. Depoloyed using Amazon Sagemaker. 
  
  dog-breed-classifier: A deep learning neural network that can recognize dog breeds from pictures.
  
  face-generator: A GAN that generates new celebrity faces.
  
  rnn-sentiment-analysis: RNN that makes use of embedding and LSTM cells to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative.
  
  simulated-seinfeld: An RNN that makes use of LSTM cells and Embedding layers to generate a brand new script for an episode of Seinfeld. 
  
  udacity-gans: A worksheet generating MNIST images using GANs
  
  Deep Learning Nanodegree Certificate.pdf: My certificate certifying I passed every assignment and completed the course.
